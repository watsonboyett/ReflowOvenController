## Changes to make for Rev. B

* use larger terminal block connectors for TC and SSR wiring
* move TC terminal block to open card edge (maybe swap TC and SSR terminal block positions)
* provide safety mechanism for using external SSR (ensure that internal SSR isn't active)
** perhaps a jumper for setting internal/external SSR
* provide breakout connections for unused pins (for switches, LCD panel, or other sensors)
* add power and heartbeat LED indicators (HB can be piggybacked off of D13)
* add product name and revision info to silkscreen text
* wrap schematic in letterbox frame (keep to one page)
* Add "Risk of Shock" warnings to MAINS partition (both sides)
