## Changes to make for Rev. B

* provide safety mechanism for using external SSR (ensure that internal SSR isn't active)
** perhaps a jumper for setting internal/external SSR
* provide breakout connections for unused pins (for switches, LCD panel, or other sensors)
* Add "Risk of Shock" warnings to MAINS partition (both sides)
